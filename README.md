# EtherMonitor
Monitoring tools for road incident management and reducing traffic congestion. Crowdsourcing information sharing for better and safer roads.

Goal: Effective design, engineering and delivery of Ethereum blockchain technology aided solution for vehicles and citizens to make roads safer and better for everyone using predictive analytics and automation. 

Solution: Technical solution for citizens, police officers and drivers to report and manage incidents, detect and prevent accidents on web and mobile.

Frontend: We have developed a road incident management system using Javascript, HTML5, SAP's UI5 on the front end using Livepeer open source video streaming system and crowdsourcing marketplace using Zora's auction house template for enabling sharing of government assets like toll prepaid card, car details information for interstate travel, driving license management and quarterly pollution check and control powered by Ethercalc (SocialCalc), Zora, Polygon, NFT.Storage, ethpass, Litprotocol for security and neume for data retrieval and live peer for online video streaming at the road incident spot for better coordination and immediate action.
How it works:
1. Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with integration with Livepeer, NFT.Storage for snapshots of road incident, ethpass for toll ticketing, neume for data retrieval.
2. Object Detection using Livepeer and Pytorch/Tensorflow deep learning library using CNN neural networks.
3.  Video analytics configuration using NFT.Storage, Litprotocol for security and neume for data retrieval.
4. Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics using Livepeer for streaming, Litprotocol for security and NFT.Storage for snapshots.
5. Alarm storage using Ethereum. Save/delete alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS using NFT.Storage. Store the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network using  NFT.Storage, Litprotocol for security and neume for data retrieval.. Provide links to alarms and blockchain transaction details.
6. Alarm Viewer: Add alarms with a single touch.
Open the Alarm Settings menu from the home page.
Add an alarm, set the wallpaper or choose an alarm tone.
You can also delete an existing alarm.
We are using Zora's Auction House template for NFT marketplace of alarm clock wallpapers and background ringtones purchase and auction.
We are also extending and adapting Turtle Music using NFT Experiments for music curators for alarm clock.
We are using DAOtooling for coordination with a social focus around community collaboration for road incidents and alarms.
