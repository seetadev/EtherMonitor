# LIT Protocol Minimal JWT Example

*This example is powered by the lit-js-sdk located here: https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/lit-js-sdk*

This repo is a minimal example to: 
1. Mint an NFT (client side)
2. Provision access to a resource (a web url) behind ownership of that NFT (client side)
3. Request a signed JWT from the Lit network to access that resource (client side)
4. Verify the signature on that JWT (server side)

The server is inside the file server.js.  The client is inside index.html

## Running
